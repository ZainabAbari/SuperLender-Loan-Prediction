# SuperLender-Loan-Prediction
This project predicts whether a loan will be Good (1) or Bad (0) using machine learning models. The goal is to help SuperLender assess credit risk effectively.

## Datasets
1. **traindemographics.csv** â€“ Customer demographic information  
2. **trainperf.csv** â€“ Performance of current loans (target: good_bad_flag)  
3. **trainprevloans.csv** â€“ History of previous loans  
4. **test...** files â€“ Similar structure for testing

## Features
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, datetime conversion)
- Feature engineering (loan ratios, repayment gaps, etc.)
- Correlation analysis via heatmap
- Multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - SVM
  - KNN
  - LightGBM
  - XGBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
- Model comparison and evaluation using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

---

## Results
- LightGBM achieved the best performance (highest ROC-AUC).  
- Feature importance plots highlight key predictors of loan repayment.
